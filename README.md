# Starbucks Promotional Dataset Project

## Project Overview:
The project involves analysing a large dataset from Starbucks that simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers.

The goal is to find the hidden traits that influence the purchasing patterns of certain individuals in the dataset. People produce various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases.

There are no explicit products to track. Only the amounts of each transaction or offer  are recorded.

There are three types of offers that can be sent:
1. BOGO, buy-one-get-one: user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount. 
2. Discount: a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent. 
3. Informational: there is no reward.

The basic task is to use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present each type of offer.
