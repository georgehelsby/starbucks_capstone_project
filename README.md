# Starbucks Promotional Dataset Project

## Project Overview:
The project involves analysing a **large simulated dataset from Starbucks that tracks a promotional campaign**.

Analysing how users make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by 10 different promotional offers.

The goal is to **find the hidden traits that influence the purchasing patterns of certain individuals** in the dataset. People produce various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases.

There are no explicit products to track. Only the amounts of each transaction or offer  are recorded.

There are three types of offers that can be sent:
1. BOGO, buy-one-get-one: user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount. 
2. Discount: a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent. 
3. Informational: there is no reward.

The basic task is to **use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to which types of offers, and how best to present each offer**.
